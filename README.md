## Breach House Crawler

Breach House Crawler is a project designed to track ransomware leaks, Breaches, stealer logs, and leads from various sources across the web.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main components:

- **app/**: This directory contains the frontend of the project, which provides a user interface to interact with and visualize the data collected by the crawler.

- **crawler/**: This directory contains the backend of the project, responsible for crawling and gathering information on ransomware leaks, breaches, stealer logs, and leads.

## Features

- **Ransomware Leak Tracking**: Real-time tracking of new ransomware leaks and disclosures.
- **Security Breach Monitoring**: Identification of compromised data from security breaches.
- **Stealer Logs**: Detection and monitoring of stealer logs (malware logs that collect stolen data).
- **Leads**: Gathering and presenting information on potential threat actors and relevant cybersecurity data.

## How to Run

To start the application, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `/app/` directory in your terminal.
2. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   pip3 install -r requirements.tx
   python3 app.py
3. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:5000 to access the website.


## Inspiration

The goal is to provide a robust and accessible tool that delivers real-time visibility into the growing ecosystem of ransomware leaks, Breaches, Leads and Stealerlogs.

## Manifesto: An Open World is a Safer World

We believe that transparency and access to information are essential for the security of everyone. In an era where data breaches and ransomware attacks are commonplace, keeping information hidden only benefits attackers. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate that an open world, where information on attacks and leaks is available for study and understanding, is a safer world.

Knowledge is power, and access to information can help mitigate future attacks, improve incident response, and better prepare cybersecurity professionals.

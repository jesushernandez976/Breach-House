Breach.house is a personal project that I have developed independently and outside of my working hours. 


The information on Breach.house website has not been verified, it is dynamically generated based on hosting choices of real-world threat actors in near-real-time. Whilst sanitisation efforts have been taken, by viewing or accessing ransomwatch you acknowledge you are doing so at your own risk.

Breach.house is only an inventory of claims that are the sole responsibility of their authors and does not constitute confirmation or validation of their allegations.

It has been established that some claims are abusive. Any victim claims by cybercriminals should be approached with caution and not considered verified without confirmation.
